Hold on, hold on.
Let's shake things up, bro.
Do you have the guts
to eat this brownie?
-Did you make it?
-And it's strong, man.
Eat only half of it
and it'll hit you.
-Only half, brother?
-It does not...
Ok, go ahead, you cowboy.
I'm telling you, it's strong.
It's not strong,
it didn't hit me, man.
Oh, no, it didn't...
-Then why are you so high?
-Who's high?
You're on the table
playing video games, man.
I'm not playing
video games... hey!
What am I doing here?
You're stoned,
I'm telling you, man.
I'm not stoned, bro, I'm just up
here to play, but I'm cool.
So you eat broccoli
with Nutella when you're cool?
I'm not eating broc...
This stuff is pretty strong.
What's going on here?
I told you it was strong, man.
But I must confess
that tattoo surprised me.
Tattoo?
What tattoo? Here?
Is there a mirror to look in?
Aaaah! Fuck!
Oh my God!
I'm completely
out of control, man.
Where did you get this thing?
That guy we met...
-Carlos, move!
-What's up?
You're swinging your dick
out of the window.
I'm swinging my dick out of...
What am I doing, man?
-For God's sake, man.
-Help me out, man!
I'm not well.
Relax, just a few more hours
and it will pass.
What do you mean by
a few more hours?
We ate the brownie
2 minutes ago.
If we'd eaten it 2 minutes ago
you'd have time to do that?
Did I do this, dude?
-You did.
-How beautiful. Who's that?
You made a Renaissance
painting with shit.
Why did I do that, man?
I tried to stop you, but after
you kidnapped Otávio Mesquita
I gave up.
I kidnapped who?
Why did I kidnap
Otávio Mesquita?!
He didn't want to give to you
Arlete Salles' SSN.
This place smells like shit!
You bastard!
Get me out of here, goddammit!
Why would I need
Arlete Salles' SSN?!
To transfer 14 thousand
to Arlete Salles.
But I did not do it.
Why did I do that?
I've been saving for 3 years!
Arlete Salles is fucking rich!
Will she give it back to me
if I ask her, man?!
Calm down, Carlos.
Stay calm, okay?
First thing,
drop the gun before...
What gun, man? What... Ahh!!!
I don't want that!
For God's sake.
Stay calm. Relax.
Let's go back, okay?
-Breathe deeply, okay?
-I'm breathing.
Breath in...
Let it go!
Let it go!
I'm letting it go, man.
Let go of my balls,
motherfucker!
Ouch, sorry!
-Does it hurt?
-It fucking hurts.
Relax. It will pass.
Nothing that another blowjob
won't solve.
Another blowjob?
Talk to Octavio.
There goes Toró...
...kicks to Chulapa...
...it's Chulapa's goal.
Goal.
Congratulations, man.
Great goal.
Now will you let me go, man?
Can't do that, boy.
I'm busy here.
